# Link-Visitor-Using-Proxies
This is an educational purpose code that teaches about python selenium etc. 


This project is a Python-based tool designed to fetch, validate, and use proxies to browse a list of links automatically in the background. The tool supports fetching proxies from multiple sources, validating them, and using them with a headless browser for seamless browsing. An executable version of the script is also provided for ease of use.

Features

1. Proxy Management

Fetches proxies from multiple online sources.

Validates proxies by testing them against a known website (e.g., Google).

Maintains a pool of valid proxies for browsing.

2. Automated Browsing

Uses a headless Edge browser to navigate through links.

Simulates user behavior by scrolling up and down on each page.

Retries browsing up to 3 times if a link fails to load.

3. Custom Logging

Logs all actions with timestamps to a log file.

Captures errors and saves them to a dedicated error log file.

4. Background Execution

Runs silently in the background once executed.

Designed to handle proxies and browsing automatically without user intervention.

Usage

Files Included:

links.txt: A text file where you can add the links to be browsed. Each link should be on a new line.

exe: The compiled executable version of the script for easy execution.

Steps to Use:

Place the links you want to browse in links.txt.

Run the executable file (.exe).

The program will:

Fetch and validate proxies.

Use the proxies to browse the links in links.txt.

Log all activities in a log file generated in the same directory.

Known Issues

Proxy Pool Depletion:

If all proxies in the pool fail, the program might pause while attempting to fetch new proxies.

Ensure stable internet connectivity for uninterrupted proxy fetching.

Executable Errors:

The .exe version may encounter issues if dependencies like msedgedriver.exe are not in the same directory or correctly configured.

Slow Proxy Validation:

Validating a large number of proxies may take time depending on the response speed of proxy sources.
